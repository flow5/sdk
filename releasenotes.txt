** from v0.1.1 => v0.1.3 (0.1.3 on npm)
- new install instructions (see README)
- new URL format (see README)
- new command line tools (see README)
- npm install from npmjs.org registry
- in resource.json files, references should be wrapped with url(path) if inlining is needed. external references 
	can be used directly e.g. image: "http://etc"
- f5.Picture widget now requires that the associated element is an img (rather than nesting an img below)
- services can be exposed by adding service_name.js under /services/ a service is passed query and callback. if
a file of the same name as the service (no extension) can be found under www it will be served in preference

** from v0.1.3 => v0.1.12
- add dependency on f5.google or f5.facebook to get this functionality
